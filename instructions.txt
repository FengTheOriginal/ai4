You need to find a secret message hidden in an image file

For your instructions, you need to go to the images directory

You can do that by typing in cd images

Once you are in the folder, type in ls -la

You should see a lot of information but we want to focus on the size of the characters
All the files have a 6026 character file size... or do they?

If only we could check if there was file bigger than that size...

Well there is!
Type in or Copy: find -type f -size +6026c
We are using the find command
-type f: means to search only regular files
-size +6026c: search for files larger than 6026 bytes

Once you find the file

Type in: steghide extract -sf <filename> -xf /tmp/flag.txt
If prompted for a password: just type in password

-sf <filename>: stands for stegofile, don't forget to replace <filename> with the actual name
-xf: this means specify extraction target file and tells the command to extract the data to /tmp/flag.txt

Then write cat /tmp/flag.txt 

Instructions for second challenge (are in seperate files, just for convinience):

In this one you have to find the correct user and password

Start by typing in this command:

nohup python3 startup.py &

then control + c
then python3 server.py
